# SECURITY BENEFITS:
# - Automatic security updates for vulnerable dependencies
# - Regular version updates to stay current with patches
# - Reduces technical debt and security risks
# - Automated PR creation for review

# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
#
# 1. Review all PRs before merging, even automated ones
# 2. Run full test suite on dependency updates
# 3. Check for breaking changes in changelogs
# 4. Monitor security advisories separately
# 5. Keep production dependencies minimal
# 6. Pin major versions for stability
# 7. Use lock files (package-lock.json)
# 8. Test in staging before production deployment
#
# ADDITIONAL SECURITY TOOLS:
#
# - npm audit: Run regularly in CI/CD
# - Snyk: Advanced vulnerability scanning
# - GitHub Security Advisories: Enable for automatic alerts
# - OWASP Dependency-Check: Deep security analysis
# - Renovate: Alternative to Dependabot with more features
