UX Pilot Brief: WhatsApp SaaS Booking Automation Platform
🎯 Project Overview
Product: Multi-tenant WhatsApp booking automation platform for beauty salons
Target Market: International (multi-language support)
Primary Audience: Beauty salon owners, spa managers, wellness center operators
Goal: Convert visitors into paying subscribers through compelling UX and psychological triggers

📊 Product Description
What We Do:
An AI-powered platform that automates customer booking through WhatsApp Business API. Salon owners can manage appointments, send automatic reminders, reduce no-shows, and grow revenue without manual message handling.
Core Value Proposition:

24/7 automated booking through WhatsApp (most popular messaging app globally)
40-50% reduction in no-shows through smart reminders
15+ hours saved per week on manual scheduling
Real-time calendar synchronization
Multi-master scheduling
Customer database management
Analytics and revenue tracking

Target User Persona:
Primary: Maria (35-50 years old)

Owns 1-3 beauty salons
Manages 3-10 staff members
Receives 50-200 booking requests per week
Struggles with:

Lost bookings from delayed WhatsApp responses
No-shows (20-30% of appointments)
Time wasted on manual scheduling
Double-bookings and conflicts
Working after-hours responding to messages



Pain Points:

Losing clients to faster-responding competitors
Revenue loss from no-shows and cancellations
Chaotic scheduling across multiple masters
No visibility into business metrics
Manual reminder sending (often forgotten)


🌍 Multi-Language Requirements

Russian
Spanish
Portuguese (Brazil)

UX Considerations:

Language switcher in header (globe icon + dropdown)

All UI elements must be flexible for text expansion (German is 30% longer than English)
Date/time formats localized per region
Currency display based on user location (auto-detect or manual selection)
Localized success stories/testimonials per region
WhatsApp integration messaging in user's chosen language
